        <h4>Why this is not a PHP Composer package</h4>
        <p>
            The SWSE is within only one file and it's not intended to build complex projects. For 
            something robust - use Laravel, Symfony, or other full-featured frameworks. The SWSE is meant to 
            be simple and easy to use without the need of Composer or other package managers.
